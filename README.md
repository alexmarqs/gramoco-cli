## Purpose üéØ

A friend of mine asked me to help him extract some data from his Instagram account. His main goal was to extract the comments from a post to a Excel file. I thought it would be a good idea to create a CLI app that could help him and other people to do this kind of tasks. This is the result.

## Tech stack ü§ì

- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) For testing
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) For type checking
- [ofetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ofetch) For making HTTP requests
- [Tsup](https://tsup.egoist.dev) For bundling
- [Tsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsx) To run TypeScript files
- [Pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) Package your Node.js project into an executable

## Download üì•

You can download the latest version in the [releases page](https://github.com/alexmarqs/gramoco-cli/releases) for your operating system. In alternative, you can clone this repository and build the project yourself and then install it globally (**advanced/developer users**).

## How to use / Instructions üìñ

In the downloaded zip folder you will find the executable file and a config file `gramoco.config.json`. In the config file you will need to fill in the following properties: ```INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN``` and ```INSTAGRAM_ACCOUNT_ID```. You can find the instructions to get these values in the [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) file.

## TODO üìù

- [ ] Right now we are keeping the data in memory and then writing it to a file. This is not a good practice for large amounts of data (which may be not the case for most users). We should write the data to a file as soon as we get it from the API using streams. Add some tests to check the performance of the app.
