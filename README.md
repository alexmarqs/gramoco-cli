## Purpose ðŸŽ¯

A friend of mine needed help extracting data from his Instagram account. He mainly wanted to get the comments from a post into an Excel file. I thought, why not make a CLI app for this? It could be useful for him and others needing to do the same thing. So, here's what I ended up creating.
